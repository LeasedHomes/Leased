## Description

The Leased app should enable end users to securely list & locate apartment rental services. Renters should be able to filter for uploaded listings by properties servicers, sign e-leases, complete an online rental application, book appointments, manage appointments, purchase a fast and eazy pass, and review their payment history.

For servicers, should have the ability to make a profile on our system, list their unit securely using workflows (virtual tours & 3D floor plans), update their listing, manage appointments, create an online lease, purchase a fast and eazy pass, collect online rental payments, and review their payment history.

We want to launch an MVP that includes the rental and roommate services at first and then 3 more services after the 1st 5000 users. Our goal is to develop a one-stop apartment rental service where renters can locate & match needed rental services and servicers can list their rental service & match with prospective tenants. The UI needs to enable future advancements for other servicing groups to have the ability also create an account and upload their listing.
